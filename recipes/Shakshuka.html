        This shakshuka for one is for those days when you need a break from breakfast cereal, and crave something that will sustain you for most of the day, while making you feel very happy and satisfied. By all means, serve this with bread so that you can mop up every bit of the tomato, pepper, and mushroom sauce, along with the delicious, hopefully somewhat runny, yolk.
